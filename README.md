# Stacks and Queues

Zachary Thomas homework for CIS 263 Ira Woodring

Stacks and Queues are some of the most important data structures in Computer Science.  As you saw in class, they are just lists with access control limits that force them to be used in particular ways.  By forcing users to adhere to these access mechanisms we can solve some potentially hard problems in very simple ways.

## Assignment

Clone (don't fork) my project template, or follow the instructions I posted in the Youtube video to create a new repository.  Call this repo YOUR_NAME_stacks_queues.  Please remember to provide your actual name and not the words "YOUR_NAME" in the title (I only mention this because people have before...).

Create a ```functions.h file``` (should be in ```includes```).  In this file include the following function signatures:

```C++
  bool balancedSymbols(std::string input);
  std::string iToP(std::string input);
```

Create a ```functions.cpp``` (should be in ```src```) file.  In this file implement the functions from the \*.h file.  The functions specifics are:

- ```balancedSymbols``` takes as input a string of arbitrary length.  It checks the entire file to determine if there is a closing parenthesis, square bracket, and curly brace for every corresponding opening symbol.  Use a std::stack<char, std::deque<char> >.
- ```iToP``` takes as input a valid infix expression and returns the corresponding postfix expression.  

This is an individual assignment.  Talk to others but don't share code.

## Thoughts...

The book has some very good explanations of these topics...

These seem like good exam questions...
